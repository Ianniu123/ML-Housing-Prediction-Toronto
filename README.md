# ML-Housing-Prediction-Toronto
This program roughly predicts the housing prices in Toronto using Linear Regression and XGBoost
Implemented using scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib

Project Layout:

Backend - django + sklearn 
Frontend - JavaScript + react

Step 1: Data Collection (RapidApi)

Step 2: Data Processing (JavaScript and Pandas)

Step 3: Use Machine Learning Model as predictions (Linear Regression and XGBoost) 

Step 4: Make Backend of website (Current)

Step 5: Make frontend

Step 6: deploy

Switch to PyTorch After Learning PyTorch
